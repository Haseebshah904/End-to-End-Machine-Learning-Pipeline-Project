# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Pipeline-Project
This repository contains the code for an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including data cleaning, model building, model saving and loading, FastAPI endpoint creation, and deployment on Hugging Face with a simple UI using Gradio or Streamlit.
# Project Structure

The project is organized into separate folders for each part of the assignment:

 data_cleaning: Contains the script for data cleaning and preprocessing.

 model train: Contains the script for building and evaluating the machine learning model.
 
 model saving and loading: Contains the script for saving and loading the trained model.
 
 api: Contains the script for creating the FastAPI application and prediction endpoint.

 app: Contains the script for creating the Gradio file and  deployment instructions.
